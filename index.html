        Hello and welcome to my site! I mainly do digital illustrations, but I
        also like to work with physical mediums such as gouache and Copics. I'm
        currently trying to get into clay modeling. Making plushies also seems
        pretty cool, but I don't have a sewing machine yet. I love grindy games.
