      <h1>What is this page?</h1>
      <p>
        Hello here is a page where I will brain dump some random things I've
        been thinking about... Maybe I should answer frequently asked questions
        here.
      </p>
      <h2>Favorite anime</h2>
      <p>
        I used to watch anime a lot more back in school, but I don't do it as
        much anymore... I've gotten new hobbies, but I swear anime actually did
        peak in like 2011. (Maybe that is dating myself.) Here are some
        favorites, in no particular order.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Fate/Zero</strong> -- This was the first Fate anime I watched!
        Sorry I'm a secondary, but I read the VN right after, and I recall still
        liking the anime more. The music is great and the plot is pretty epic.
        Sure it's also kind of stupid, but isn't that the Fate plot in a
        nutshell? I haven't rewatched this because I'm scared I won't like it
        anymore because I was pretty young when I watched it the first time.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Haruhi</strong> -- Apparently zoomers don't watch Haruhi these
        days... What a shame, it's a fantastic anime.
        <em>Disappearance</em> holds up as well! The writing is quite good for
        LN standards, and the characters (sans Haruhi) are quite likeable. My
        favorite character is Yuki. I watched 1, 2, 8 of Endless Eight, so maybe
        I'm not a real fan.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Welcome to the NHK</strong> -- I watched this one in high school
        and found it pretty gripping. I liked how it was very relatable to
        ota-NEETs. I haven't rewatched this one either, but I have a feeling I
        would still like it... I hope.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Shinsekai Yori</strong> -- Apparently this show was based off a
        real novel, which is why the plot is actually pretty good. I marathoned
        this show over band camp. I really liked the world building! Squealer
        did nothing wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Monogatari series</strong> -- Okay I know this is technically
        not a single anime, but this series is so formulaic that I'll just count
        it as one. I didn't like this series the first time I watched it, but I
        decided to rewatch it on a whim, and wow, it's a genuinely fantastic
        series! I think I just got filtered the first time around because I was
        too young or something. The writing, while not perfect, is definitely
        heads and tails above other similar shows. The character design is
        fantastic. Love the music.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Tokyo Magnitude 8.0</strong> -- This was one of the first "real"
        anime I watched after stuff like Dragon Ball or Naruto because I googled
        "top saddest anime". This show did indeed make me cry. Apparently not
        that many people have heard of it. I am also afraid to rewatch this one.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Madoka</strong> -- Everyone and their mother has seen this show,
        but it's good. Great writing, great characters, great music. What more
        could you want?
