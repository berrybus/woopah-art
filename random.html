      <h1>What is this page?</h1>
      <p>
        Hello here is a page where I will brain dump some random things I've
        been thinking about... Maybe I should answer frequently asked questions
        here.
      </p>
      <h2>Favorite anime</h2>
      <p>
        I used to watch anime a lot more back in school, but I don't do it as
        much anymore... I've gotten new hobbies, but I swear anime actually did
        peak in like 2011. (Maybe that is dating myself.) Here are some
        favorites, in no particular order.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Fate/Zero</strong> -- This was the first Fate anime I watched!
        Sorry I'm a secondary, but I read the VN right after, and I recall still
        liking the anime more. The music is great and the plot is pretty epic.
        Sure it's also kind of stupid, but isn't that the Fate plot in a
        nutshell? I haven't rewatched this because I'm scared I won't like it
        anymore because I was pretty young when I watched it the first time.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Haruhi</strong> -- Apparently zoomers don't watch Haruhi these
        days... What a shame, it's a fantastic anime.
        <em>Disappearance</em> holds up as well! The writing is quite good for
        LN standards, and the characters (sans Haruhi) are quite likeable. My
        favorite character is Yuki. I watched 1, 2, 8 of Endless Eight, so maybe
        I'm not a real fan.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Welcome to the NHK</strong> -- I watched this one in high school
        and found it pretty gripping. I liked how it was very relatable to
        ota-NEETs. I haven't rewatched this one either, but I have a feeling I
        would still like it... I hope.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Shinsekai Yori</strong> -- Apparently this show was based off a
        real novel, which is why the plot is actually pretty good. I marathoned
        this show over band camp. I really liked the world building! Squealer
        did nothing wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Monogatari series</strong> -- Okay I know this is technically
        not a single anime, but this series is so formulaic that I'll just count
        it as one. I didn't like this series the first time I watched it, but I
        decided to rewatch it on a whim, and wow, it's a genuinely fantastic
        series! I think I just got filtered the first time around because I was
        too young or something. The writing, while not perfect, is definitely
        heads and tails above other similar shows. The character design is
        fantastic. Love the music.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Tokyo Magnitude 8.0</strong> -- This was one of the first "real"
        anime I watched after stuff like Dragon Ball or Naruto because I googled
        "top saddest anime". This show did indeed make me cry. Apparently not
        that many people have heard of it. I am also afraid to rewatch this one.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Madoka</strong> -- Everyone and their mother has seen this show,
        but it's good. Great writing, great characters, great music. What more
        could you want?
      </p>

      <h2>Video games</h2>
      <p>
        People often assume I play a lot of video games, but I really don't. I
        just don't have enough time nowadays to sink into something like
        Earthbound, which, while long, is a soulful and fantastic game (that I
        never finished).
      </p>

      <p>
        I also started playing Persona 5, and I quite liked the approximately
        five hours I've played of it so far, but then I run into the issue of
        not having enough time to commit the 50+ hours upfront to play the game.
        However, when I try to play in chunks, I lose too much interest and
        context between sessions that I end up never picking the game back up,
        which is why I'm still stuck at the part right after the first dungeon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Don't get me wrong, I do love those long and immersive games, but I find
        that the 9-5 job simply leaves you with not enough time to play them.
        What I could do is drop everything else and <em>only</em> play video
        games after work, but there are so many other things I want to do as
        well!
      </p>

      <p>
        It seems that one solution that the market offers for this problem is a
        category of games that only take a short amount of time every day,
        gachas. But I can't keep up with the new gacha that comes out every
        couple of months! The only gacha I play right now is Blue Archive, but
        I'm pretty casual. The art is nice and the girls are cute.
      </p>

      <p>
        I played a lot of Maplestory when I was a kid. I never got beyond like
        level 50. I really liked the social aspect of it, which I keep trying to
        find in modern MMOs, but MMOs are another category of games that don't
        respect your time. One exception is FFXIV, currently one of the most
        popular MMOs, but I couldn't get into it. I tried multiple times! The
        combat didn't interest me very much because it was more involved than
        the mindlessly entertaining one button mash of level 25 Maplestory, but
        it wasn't deep enough to make it actually fun. Also, everyone kept
        telling me that the story is amazing, but I just couldn't get into it!
        One roadblock for the story was that there were so many cutscenes in
        which you had to wait for a character to finish speaking, and maybe I'm
        too ADHD for this, but I just got SO BORED with the cutscenes that I
        started playing tetris on the side! I like the text dialogue more
        because you can read at your own pace.
      </p>

      <p>
        Speaking of reading, I love playing visual novels! I know that some
        people don't consider these games since there's often very little
        gameplay (some VNs don't even have choices!) but I love that about them.
        Gameplay that's too complex makes my brain hurt. I want my gameplay to
        be on autopilot, thank you very much. Here's some VNs that I really
        enjoyed playing:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>Tsukihime (OG and remake; the remake is good!)</p></li>
        <li><p>Subahibi</p></li>
        <li><p>Fata Morgana</p></li>
        <li><p>Dies Irae</p></li>
        <li><p>Muramasa</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Funnily enough, I often like <em>making</em> games more than
        <em>playing</em>
        them! In a way, game dev is like the ultimate sandbox game. I love
        exploring new game dev technologies. I've used Flash, GameMaker, Unity,
        Godot, RenPy, and others. You can check out my most recent games at my
        <a href="https://www.kiyummi.com">game studio website</a>.
        Unfortunately, due to the lack of time issue mentioned above, the game
        dev work has been put on a bit of a hiatus for now, but perhaps I will
        get back into it at some point!
      </p>

      <h2>How I made this website</h2>
      <p>
        Whenever I made websites in the past, they were all frankenstein'd
        StackOverflow answers and flavor of the month frameworks, but this time
        I wanted to commit to actually learning HTML/CSS/Javascript! I don't
        want to learn a new JS framework every couple of months just to be able
        to make a website, and, really, do I need React for my STATIC personal
        site? The modern internet is way too bloated!
      </p>
      <p>
        So this website was made with all HANDWRITTEN code with zero frameworks.
        I manually wrote the CSS instead of importing bootstrap. I did use
        StackOverflow for the image expansion Javascript, but I understood the
        code and modified it for my needs.
      </p>

      <h2>What's on my reading list?</h2>
      <p>
        Currently going through a sociology and philosophy phase. Might move on
        to history next.

          <p>

            slow progress because I only read it when I have insomnia)

        </li>
        <li><p>The Body Keeps Score - van der Kolk (currently reading)</p></li>
