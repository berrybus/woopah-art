    <h1>What is this page?</h1>
    <p>
      Hello here is a page where I will brain dump some random things I've
      been thinking about... Maybe I should answer frequently asked questions
      here.
    </p>

    <h2>Drawing setup</h2>
    <p>
      My setup has gone through many changes over the years. I currently use a Wacom Intuos Pro with Krita on a Windows
      machine. In the past, I've used a Cintiq 16 (not Pro) on CSP on both Windows and Linux. I decided
      to stick with only Windows because I play too many Windows-only games and dual-booting is kind of annoying. I'm
      also in the process of learning Krita because I don't like the CSP pricing changes. The switch from screen -> non
      screen tablet was because leaning over constantly for hours while drawing was hurting my back :')
    </p>

    <h2>Favorite anime</h2>
    <p>
      I used to watch anime a lot more back in school, but I don't do it as
      much anymore... I've gotten new hobbies, but I swear anime actually did
      peak in like 2011. (Maybe that is dating myself.) Here are some
      favorites, in no particular order.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Fate/Zero</strong> -- This was the first Fate anime I watched!
      Sorry I'm a secondary, but I read the VN right after, and I recall still
      liking the anime more. The music is great and the plot is pretty epic.
      Sure it's also kind of stupid, but isn't that the Fate plot in a
      nutshell? I haven't rewatched this because I'm scared I won't like it
      anymore because I was pretty young when I watched it the first time.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Haruhi</strong> -- Apparently zoomers don't watch Haruhi these
      days... What a shame, it's a fantastic anime.
      <em>Disappearance</em> holds up as well! The writing is quite good for
      LN standards, and the characters (sans Haruhi) are quite likeable. My
      favorite character is Yuki. I watched 1, 2, 8 of Endless Eight, so maybe
      I'm not a real fan.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Welcome to the NHK</strong> -- I watched this one in high school
      and found it pretty gripping. I liked how it was very relatable to
      ota-NEETs. I haven't rewatched this one either, but I have a feeling I
      would still like it... I hope.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Shinsekai Yori</strong> -- Apparently this show was based off a
      real novel, which is why the plot is actually pretty good. I marathoned
      this show over band camp. I really liked the world building! Squealer
      did nothing wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Monogatari series</strong> -- Okay I know this is technically
      not a single anime, but this series is so formulaic that I'll just count
      it as one. I didn't like this series the first time I watched it, but I
      decided to rewatch it on a whim, and wow, it's a genuinely fantastic
      series! I think I just got filtered the first time around because I was
      too young or something. The writing, while not perfect, is definitely
      heads and tails above other similar shows. The character design is
      fantastic. Love the music.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Tokyo Magnitude 8.0</strong> -- This was one of the first "real"
      anime I watched after stuff like Dragon Ball or Naruto because I googled
      "top saddest anime". This show did indeed make me cry. Apparently not
      that many people have heard of it. I am also afraid to rewatch this one.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Madoka</strong> -- Everyone and their mother has seen this show,
      but it's good. Great writing, great characters, great music. What more
      could you want?
    </p>

    <h2>Video games</h2>
    <p>
      People often assume I play a lot of video games, but I really don't. I
      just don't have enough time nowadays to sink into something like
      Earthbound, which, while long, is a soulful and fantastic game (that I
      never finished).
    </p>

    <p>
      I also started playing Persona 5, and I quite liked the approximately
      five hours I've played of it so far, but then I run into the issue of
      not having enough time to commit the 50+ hours upfront to play the game.
      However, when I try to play in chunks, I lose too much interest and
      context between sessions that I end up never picking the game back up,
      which is why I'm still stuck at the part right after the first dungeon.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don't get me wrong, I do love those long and immersive games, but I find
      that the 9-5 job simply leaves you with not enough time to play them.
      What I could do is drop everything else and <em>only</em> play video
      games after work, but there are so many other things I want to do as
      well!
    </p>

    <p>
      It seems that one solution that the market offers for this problem is a
      category of games that only take a short amount of time every day,
      gachas. But I can't keep up with the new gacha that comes out every
      couple of months! The only gacha I play right now is Blue Archive, but
      I'm pretty casual. The art is nice and the girls are cute.
    </p>

    <p>
      I played a lot of Maplestory when I was a kid. I never got beyond like
      level 50. I really liked the social aspect of it, which I keep trying to
      find in modern MMOs, but MMOs are another category of games that don't
      respect your time. One exception is FFXIV, currently one of the most
      popular MMOs, but I couldn't really get into it. The
      combat didn't interest me very much because it was more involved than
      the mindlessly entertaining one button mash of level 25 Maplestory, but
      it felt too mechanical to be fun. Also, everyone kept
      telling me that the story is amazing, but I couldn't get into that either!
      One roadblock for the story was that there were so many cutscenes in
      which you had to wait for a character to finish speaking, and maybe I'm
      too ADHD for this, but I just got SO BORED with the cutscenes that I
      started playing tetris on the side! I like the text dialogue more
      because you can read at your own pace. But my friends are really into it, so I figure I'll give it a couple more
      shots.
    </p>

    <p>
      Funnily enough, I often like <em>making</em> games more than
      <em>playing</em>
      them! In a way, game dev is like the ultimate sandbox game. I love
      exploring new game dev technologies. I've used Flash, GameMaker, Unity,
      Godot, RenPy, and others. You can check out my most recent games at my
      <a href="https://www.kiyummi.com">game studio website</a>.
      Unfortunately, due to the lack of time issue mentioned above, the game
      dev work has been put on a bit of a hiatus for now, but perhaps I will
      get back into it at some point!

    <h2>How I made this website</h2>
    <p>
      Whenever I made websites in the past, they were all frankenstein'd
      StackOverflow answers and flavor of the month frameworks, but this time
      I wanted to commit to actually learning HTML/CSS/Javascript! I don't
      want to learn a new JS framework every couple of months just to be able
      to make a website, and, really, do I need React for my STATIC personal
      site? The modern internet is way too bloated!
    </p>
    <p>
      So this website was made with all HANDWRITTEN code with zero frameworks.
      I manually wrote the CSS instead of importing bootstrap. I did use
      StackOverflow for the image expansion Javascript, but I understood the
      code and modified it for my needs.
